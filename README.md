# fpinpy

Example and trial higher order functional programming in Python.
Three goals:
* Share and educate others in applying higher order FP within classical language settings.
* Understand how best to use Python object and class artifacts to keep development productive.
* Understand how best to stage execution so as to preserve proper JAX JIT compilation even for complex constructions.
* Understand how best to package these concepts as reusable library component.

History:
* fpinpyV01: building state/maybe monads bottom up. (based on my F# presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opm3KfHLqcI )
